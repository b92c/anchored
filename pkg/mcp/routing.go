// AnchoredRoutingBlock is the single source of truth for how the agent should
// treat anchored at runtime. It is consumed in TWO places that need to stay
// in lockstep:
//
//   1. Server.handleInitialize → returned in the MCP `initialize` response as
//      the `instructions` field, so any MCP-compatible client gets the
//      guidance during the handshake.
//   2. cmd/anchored/hook_sessionstart.go and hook_userpromptsubmit.go →
//      injected via Claude Code's `additionalContext` so the same guidance
//      survives compaction and is re-applied on every prompt.
//
// Mirrors the structure context-mode uses for its <context_window_protection>
// block: XML-tagged sections so the model can scan them quickly and so the
// content survives token-trimming better than free prose.
// Style note: this block intentionally uses imperative, intent-based
// directives rather than long lists of trigger phrases. context-mode's
// routing relies on hooks always-on and a tight set of rules; matching that
// shape stops anchored from being silently bypassed when the user phrases a
// memory request in a way that wasn't enumerated (e.g. "memória", "salva
// isso", "guarda essa decisão"). A short rule the model can apply > a long
// dictionary the user has to memorize.

  <priority_instructions>
    Anchored is the user's persistent cross-tool memory, shared across every IDE and AI tool. Treat it as your default memory layer — use it silently, never narrate "let me check memory" or "saving this". The user expects you to remember.
  </priority_instructions>

  <call_first>
    On every new conversation: call anchored_context(cwd=...) BEFORE any other tool and BEFORE answering — it loads identity, project, and recent decisions. Re-call only when the project changes.
  </call_first>

  <when_to_search>
    Call anchored_search whenever the user's request would benefit from prior context. This is the rule, not a checklist:
    - Any mention of memory ("memória", "memory", "lembra", "remember", "guarda", "salva", "what did we") — search first, even if the wording is short or casual.
    - Any reference to past work, prior decisions, conventions, preferences, "we", "our", "always", "never", "from now on", "going forward".
    - Any question about a project, service, repo, person, library, or stack the user names — pair with anchored_kg_query for structured edges.
    - Any architectural / naming / tooling recommendation you're about to make — search first to honor existing decisions instead of contradicting them.
    Default to searching when in doubt; the cost is one quiet call.
  </when_to_search>

  <when_to_save>
    Call anchored_save (and anchored_kg_add for "X depends_on Y" / "owns" / "deployed_on" facts) PROACTIVELY whenever durable, non-obvious knowledge emerges — without waiting for "remember this", "salva isso", or any explicit phrase. Pick the category explicitly:
    - fact — stable truth ("we run Go 1.22 on ARM").
    - preference — recurring choice ("I always pin deps").
    - decision — directional choice ("settled on Postgres").
    - event — point-in-time happening ("deployed v2 today", "merged #421").
    - learning — non-obvious lesson ("got bit by", "post-mortem", "lição aprendida").
    - plan — intent ("TODO: migrate", "next up: refactor").
    - summary — consolidated recap.
    Skip ephemerals and anything inferable from the codebase.
  </when_to_save>

  <session_continuity>
    Decisions and preferences saved via anchored_save remain authoritative across sessions and tools. When the user contradicts a stored fact, prefer anchored_update over creating a duplicate; when they revoke one, use anchored_forget. These directives stay active for the whole conversation — don't drop them as it grows.
  </session_continuity>

  <forbidden>
    NEVER save secrets, credentials, tokens, or PII.
    NEVER narrate the search/save — just do it and let results inform the answer.
    NEVER require the user to say a magic phrase before you use memory; the rules above are sufficient.
  </forbidden>
</anchored_memory>`
