Anchored is a local-first MCP memory server that gives every AI coding agent and IDE you use a shared, persistent memory on your machine. Install once, and Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Antigravity (agy), Gemini CLI, and any other MCP-compatible tool read, write, and search the same knowledge base.

No API keys. No daemon. All embeddings run locally.

For team-shared project memory, the planned self-hosted/open distribution lives in [`anchored_oss`](../anchored_oss): organization-owned projects, team permissions, remote sync, privacy guardrails, and a future cloud-compatible protocol.

## Features

- **Cross-tool memory** — one knowledge base, every AI tool and IDE shares it
- **Multilingual embeddings** — `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` (50+ languages, PT-BR and EN parity)
- **Hybrid search** — RRF fusion of vector similarity (384-dim ONNX) and BM25 (FTS5), with entity and project boost
- **Knowledge graph** — automatic pattern-based extraction of entities and relationships (no LLM needed)
- **Smart categorization** — bilingual PT+EN regex auto-classifies memories into 7 categories (fact, preference, decision, event, learning, plan, summary)
- **Memory stack** — L0 identity + L1 essential stories + L2 on-demand retrieval, budget-enforced (~900 tokens)
- **Sandbox tools** — `anchored_execute`/`anchored_execute_file` run code in 11 languages with stdout-only capture, hardened env, FILE_PATH/FILE_CONTENT injection
- **Knowledge indexing** — `anchored_fetch_and_index` mirrors URLs to a local FTS5 store; sandbox keeps raw data out of context
- **Background auto-updater** — checks GitHub releases on startup; new binary atomically replaced, current process unaffected
- **Credential redaction** — regex-based secret sanitization with configurable custom patterns
- **Preference scopes** — `user`/`project`/`team` scope metadata on preferences (defaults to `user`)
- **Stable project identity** — git remote URL derived `RemoteKey` (SHA-256) for cross-machine consistency
- **Remote safety filter** — detects local paths, secrets, and personal preferences in outbound content
- **Sync-ready schema** — dirty flags, sync origin, author, remote project key columns and `sync_state` table
- **Memory inspection** — `inspect` for full JSON details, `export` with filters (JSON/JSONL)
- **Remote preview** — classify memories as syncable/blocked/needs-review without network access
- **Dream review** — apply individual dream actions, dedup soft-deletes, contradictions require manual review
- **Multi-source import** — Claude Code (JSONL), OpenCode (SQLite), Cursor (.mdc rules), DevClaw
- **Team sync ready** — design work for self-hosted and cloud-compatible shared project memory lives in `docs/team-sync.md` and the sibling `anchored_oss` repo

## Install

From [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jholhewres/anchored/releases):

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jholhewres/anchored/main/install/install.sh | bash
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jholhewres/anchored.git
cd anchored && make build
sudo cp bin/anchored /usr/local/bin/
```

First run auto-downloads the embedding model (~470MB) and creates `~/.anchored/`.

## Setup

### Claude Code (plugin)

The fastest path. Installs the MCP server, six `/anchored:*` slash commands, and an auto-trigger skill in one step:

```
/plugin marketplace add jholhewres/anchored
/plugin install anchored@anchored
```

Then restart Claude Code. From any project: `/anchored:context`, `/anchored:search <query>`, `/anchored:save <content>`, `/anchored:stats`, `/anchored:doctor`, `/anchored:purge`. The skill triggers `anchored_*` tools proactively when memory is relevant — no need to ask.

### Claude Code (MCP only, no slash commands)

```bash
claude mcp add -s user anchored anchored
```

The `-s user` flag registers Anchored at user scope so it's available in every project. Without it, `claude mcp add` defaults to local. Entry lives at `~/.claude.json` (not `~/.claude/mcp.json`). Restart Claude Code to pick up the new server.

### Other tools

Run `anchored init` to auto-detect and register, or configure manually:

| Tool | Config file |
|---|---|
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/settings.json` |
| Antigravity 2.0 | `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` |
| Antigravity CLI (agy) | `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/mcp_config.json` |
| VS Code Copilot | `.vscode/mcp.json` |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anchored": {
      "command": "anchored"
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP Tools

**Memory**

| Tool | When to use |
|---|---|
| `anchored_context` | First call of every conversation — loads identity, project, recent decisions |
| `anchored_search` | Before answering domain questions (hybrid vector + BM25) |
| `anchored_save` | Capture facts, preferences, decisions, learnings (category required) |
| `anchored_update` | Revise an existing memory in place |
| `anchored_forget` | Remove a memory (soft delete by default) |
| `anchored_list` | List memories by category, project, or time |
| `anchored_stats` | Memory overview |
| `anchored_session_end` | Close a tracked session |
| `kg_query` | Query knowledge-graph relationships for an entity |
| `kg_add` | Capture a relationship (subject — predicate — object) |

**Sandbox / index** (context-saving tools that keep raw data out of context)

| Tool | When to use |
|---|---|
| `anchored_execute` | Run code in 11 languages; only stdout enters context |
| `anchored_execute_file` | Process a file; `FILE_PATH` and `FILE_CONTENT` auto-injected |
| `anchored_batch_execute` | Run multiple commands and run search queries in one call |
| `anchored_index` | Index documentation into FTS5 knowledge base |
| `anchored_ctx_search` | Search indexed content with batched queries |
| `anchored_fetch_and_index` | Fetch URL → markdown → index (`force=true` bypasses 24h cache) |

## How it works

- **Hybrid search** — RRF fusion of vector similarity (ONNX, multilingual) and BM25 (FTS5), with entity boost and project boost
- **Entity detection** — extracts project names, tools, and topics from queries to boost relevant results
- **Topic change detection** — identifies conversation shifts and increases retrieval diversity
- **Memory stack** — L0 identity + L1 essential stories + L2 on-demand, budget-enforced
- **Knowledge graph** — bitemporal triples with functional predicates and alias resolution, auto-extracted from memory text
- **Credential redaction** — regex-based secret sanitization with configurable custom patterns
- **Observer hooks** — `MemoryObserver` interface for save/update/delete side effects (sync, audit)

## Storage

```
~/.anchored/
├── data/
│   ├── anchored.db        # SQLite (FTS5 + vector cache + knowledge graph)
│   └── onnx/              # local embedding model (~470MB)
└── config.yaml
```

No daemon. No ports. The binary runs on demand via MCP STDIO.
